#### Internal updates

Contains internal updates that abstract generic high level updates.

Whereas all models in `models/internal/*.proto` represent the generic 
high level *state* of the monitored system, these try to model 
*changes to the state* of the monitored system.

All interfaces are work in progress and open for discussion.
