#### Internal

Contains internal abstract generic high level models.

*Internal* refers to the fact that all models have been human-engineered and constructed
within the event processing pipeline or by auxiliary microservices.

All top level models in `models/internal/*.proto` attempt to encapsulate the generic 
high level *state* of the monitored system.

All interfaces are work in progress and open for discussion.
