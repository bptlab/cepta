## docker cheat sheet

#### Installation
Check out the guides for [windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
and [ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).

On macOS with `homebrew`, run
```
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install docker
```

We will also use `docker-compose` for development,
which is included with the macOS and Windows installation.
See [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for 
installation under linux.
